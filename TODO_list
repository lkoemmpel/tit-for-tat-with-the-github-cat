-----------------TODO List---------------------------
Make sure fitness labels don't go to 1

Add noise to interaction
add indirect reciprocity to interaction
add more nodes reproducing
Highlight nodes that have reproduced





think about structures that are interesting
like the dumbell graph

Abstract some real world phenomenon that brings some moral

what impact does the distance have on all of this


-----------------Graph Initialization------------------

	Initialize graphs with a particular strategy along one dimension 
		of the lattice

	Have different games be played on different parts of the graph




-------------------General---------------------------
	Improve/organize class structure

	test various values of delta


---------------Reproduction--------------------------
	Handle colors for each strategy
	Implement other reproduction functions like death-birth



---------------Timestep--------------------------
	plot relationship between b/c and proportion cooperators 
	graph many trials in same graph
	fix errors with saving images

	Make aggregated data object to handle data averages

	Make plotting functions to plot data and averages of data
	Add error bars to graphs of averaged data
	Delete triangular markers 
		Make error bars lines 
	Plot different data in different colors




---------------Interaction--------------------------
	make action handle other strategies
	make payoff matrix an input that varies on parts of the graph
