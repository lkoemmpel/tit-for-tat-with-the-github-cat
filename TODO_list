Highlight nodes that have reproduced

Abstract some real world phenomenon that brings some moral

-----------------Graph Initialization------------------

	Initialize graphs with a particular strategy along one dimension 
		of the lattice

	Have different games be played on different parts of the graph


-------------------General---------------------------
R	test various values of delta

---------------Reproduction--------------------------
	Implement other reproduction functions like imitation

	plot relationship between b/c and proportion cooperators 
	fix errors of the form 'node 38 has no coordinate'

---------------Interaction--------------------------
	make action handle other strategies
	make payoff matrix an input that varies on parts of the graph


---------------Wednesday goals--------------------------
B 	Highlight nodes that have reproduced
