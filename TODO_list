-----------------TODO List---------------------------


----------Things Ankor suggested---------------------
	run simulations on dumbell graphs where cooperators/defectors are grouped
	don't conflate too many variables when looking for what causes phenomenon
	examine how graph expanders affect proportion of cooperators
	




rewrite interaction
	people cooperate more with neighbors with high fitness
	implement interaction techniques from Utkovski paper
	run multiple clique dombell simulation w/o display 



R 	Keep an eye on fitness label changes

Add noise to interaction
add indirect reciprocity to interaction
add more nodes reproducing
Highlight nodes that have reproduced

Abstract some real world phenomenon that brings some moral

-----------------Graph Initialization------------------

	Initialize graphs with a particular strategy along one dimension 
		of the lattice

	Have different games be played on different parts of the graph


-------------------General---------------------------
R	test various values of delta

---------------Reproduction--------------------------
	Implement other reproduction functions like imitation

---------------Timestep--------------------------
	plot relationship between b/c and proportion cooperators 
	fix errors of the form 'node 38 has no coordinate'

---------------Interaction--------------------------
	make action handle other strategies
	make payoff matrix an input that varies on parts of the graph


---------------Wednesday goals--------------------------
B 	Highlight nodes that have reproduced
B	fix errors of the form 'node 38 has no coordinate'

O 	plot relationship between b/c and proportion cooperators 

L 	add more nodes reproducing
